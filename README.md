# ISO9001-DMS

It is a simple application that helps to manage the extensive documentation that was created as a result of the introduction of the ISO 9001 standard in the organization. This is not commercial application.

## Application development

The application was created in 2012 using the .net framework 3.5 and C#, ASP, HTML, CSS JavaScript and SQL programming languages as an ASP.NET Web Form application.

For application development I have 3 month to finish project which is in this repository.
